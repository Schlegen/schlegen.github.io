        <p>This web app presents some insights about the constant elasticity of substitution function.</p>
        <p>We first propose some plots of the function with intercative sliders. </p>
        <p>In a second part, we design and solve an optimal control problem consisting in maximizing a CES under a constraint on total investments.</p>
        <p>This app is coded in Python (Flask), HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used the Javascript framework Reveal.js that allows to build presentations with web languages.</p>
