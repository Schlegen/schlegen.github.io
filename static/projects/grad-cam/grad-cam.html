        <span>Where do a neural network looks at when predicting that a cat is a cat and a dog is a dog ?
            The answer is in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391">this article</a>.

        <span>The main idea here is to inspect the value of the gradient flowing in the last convolution layer.
            With a heatmap on this data, we highlight zones of the pictures that allowed the neural network to do its prediction.
