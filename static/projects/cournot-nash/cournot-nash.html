        <span>This project is an academic project carried out in December 2021, it is highly inspired by 
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02814">this article</a>. 
            The goal is to Compute a Cournot-Nash (Equivalent of a Nash equilibrium with a continuum of agents) 
            with optimal transport method, under separability asumptions on the costfunction.</span>

        <span>We designed a game were tourists chose their holiday destination, with the following constraints :</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> a travel cost </br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> a penalisation on non-attractiveness </br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> a capacity that ceils the density of agents in a destination</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> a penalisation on high density of tourists.
