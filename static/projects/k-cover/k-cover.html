        <span>This project is an academic project carried out in October 2021. 
            The goal is to implement an heuritic to cover a graph with a minimum of sensors.</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> Each node has to be covered by at least k sensors </br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> Sensors have to be connected together</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>-</b> Sensors have a covering radius and a communication radius
        </span>
        <span>After a Mixed-interger-Linear formulation of the problem, 
            we implemented a genetic algorithm and a local search (inspired by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494618302825">this article</a>)
