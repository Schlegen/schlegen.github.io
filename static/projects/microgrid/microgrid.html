        <span>This project is an academic project carried out during the second semester of 2019-2020. The goal is to manage a battery in a microgrid fitted with a solar pannel.</span>
            
        <span>This project uses the <b>command predictive control</b>. </span>
            
        <span>At every step: </br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>1.</b> we predict the net demand (difference between the demand and the production)</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>2.</b> we set the trajectory battery load in order to minimize the total cost.</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp<b>3.</b> only the first value of the prescription is retained
